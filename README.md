# Knowva - AI Personal Knowledge Base

An AI-powered Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) application that enables users to create, organize, search, and interact with their notes using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The application combines traditional note-taking with semantic search and AI assistance, allowing users to quickly find information and ask natural language questions about their own knowledge base.

## How RAG Works

1. User asks a question in the AI chat panel.
2. The backend generates an embedding for the question.
3. Hybrid search retrieves the most relevant notes using:

   * Keyword Search
   * Vector Search
4. Retrieved notes are injected into the LLM prompt.
5. Gemini generates an answer grounded in the retrieved notes.
6. The response and supporting source notes are returned to the frontend.
